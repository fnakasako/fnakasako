Studied pure math at Berkeley. Had literature/music theory/plastic arts obsession.

Current: Turned down offer and stopped recruiting with the aim to instead find work in creative AI space through open source contributions. 

This is better alligned with my long term goal of building intuitive GUIs that facilitate the use of AI/ML for generating high quality art (in a way that preserves human agency)


Realism is overrated and should make concessions to adult animation (Masaaki, Oshii, Ghibli, etc), which is stigmatized due to disney and commoditization of Japanese culture.
I think about language and art, and its intersection with AI a lot. 




My interests include:

- Personality/allignment (working on full proposal for OpenAI safety research)
- Low level ML infra, MLOps, distributed training
- UI/UX/design
